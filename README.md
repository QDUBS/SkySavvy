Senior Frontend Assessment

Problem:
Build a single-page web application using React JS that allows users to look up current
weather information for cities around the world and add cities to a “favorites” list.
Requirements
● Use real-time world weather API services such as weatherstack.com and/or a
location service such as goenames.org.
● By default, users should be shown a list of the 15 largest cities in the world by
population in alphabetical order and the current temperature for each.
● Users should be able to remove these entries individually from the list to clean it
up.
● Clicking on a city in the list should open a page where the user can see more
weather information. This view should include a textarea field where the user can
enter and save notes.
● Users should also be able to edit and remove notes.
● Users should be able to use a search field to look up weather details for other
cities.
● Users should be able to add/remove cities as “favorites” which will appear at the
top of the list on the home screen (also in alphabetical order).
● Except for the “search” feature, the app should retain basic functionality offline.
The most up-to-date information should be cached and persist in local storage.
● The program should be built entirely as a front end application. There should be
no back-end or database (use only local storage).
● Ask the user for permission to get their current location and open the details
page for their city after they grant it.
● Functionality should be appropriately divided into well-defined components.
● Include unit testing for applicable functionality.
● The application should have a production-ready clean/modern aesthetic.
● Use any styling and state management option of your choice, although you are
encouraged to use Material UI and Redux in your implementation.
